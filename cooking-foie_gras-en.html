       <h2> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foie_gras>Foie gras mi-cuit au torchon</a></h2>  
        There are different ways to prepare foie gras, which influence both its flavor and texture. The following method is my favorite.
       
    
        <p><hr/> </p>
        <h3>Day 1</h3> 
    
        <p>
          <img src="/assets/img/foiegras1.png" />
<br />    <br /> 
First, take the foie gras out of the refrigerator 2–3 hours in advance and make sure it has softened and become more pliable.
<br />    <br /> 
<img src="/assets/img/foiegras2.png" />
<br />    <br /> 
The foie gras is made up of two lobes: a small one and a large one. They are separated by a main vein. The first step is to separate the two lobes at this point.
<br />    <br /> 
<img src="/assets/img/foiegras3.png" />
<br />    <br /> 
We now move on to the deveining stage. This involves locating the small veins inside the foie gras and carefully removing them. To do this, gently probe to identify branching veins (sometimes found in reddish areas), grip the vein firmly, and, using a knife, gently follow the vein’s path until it is completely removed.
<br />    <br />

<br />    <br /> 
It is important to limit damage to the foie gras during this step to achieve a better final texture.
<br />    <br />

<br />    <br /> 
Next, prepare a bowl of ice-cold water with one spoonful of salt. Reassemble the foie gras, which has just been handled, and fully submerge it in the bowl. 
<br />    <br />

<br />    <br /> 
The salt will cause the blood vessels to contract, and the ice-cold water will help the foie gras tighten back onto itself. This is also an opportunity to remove any remaining red spots. Before the next step, drain the foie gras well.
<br />    <br />

<br />    <br /> 
Now comes the seasoning. In a separate bowl, and for a 1,000-gram foie gras, mix 15 grams of salt, a little pepper (4–5 generous pinches), and one tablespoon of sugar.
<br />    <br /> 
<img src="/assets/img/foiegras8.png" />
<br />    <br /> 
Add this seasoning mixture sparingly, gently turning the pieces without crushing them. To complete the seasoning, pour in a generous tablespoon of cognac.
<br />    <br /> 
Next is the resting stage. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and let the foie gras rest in the refrigerator overnight.
<br />    <br /> 


       <p><hr/> </p>
        <h3>Day 2</h3> 
    
        <p>
          <img src="/assets/img/foiegras9.png" />
<br />    <br /> 
One day later, remove the foie gras from the fridge and let it come back to room temperature before shaping it into a log.
<br />    <br /> 
<img src="/assets/img/foiegras10.png" />
<br />    <br /> 
The goal of this step is to form logs that are as compact as possible. Any air pockets left at this stage will later turn into yellow fat around the foie gras.
<br />    <br /> 
<img src="/assets/img/foiegras11.png" />
<br />    <br /> 
To shape the log, keep as many large pieces intact as possible, place them on a sheet of plastic wrap laid flat, then roll it tightly to eliminate as much air as possible. Tie a very tight knot at each end. Add a second layer of plastic wrap over the first one to secure everything.
<br />    <br /> 
<img src="/assets/img/foiegras12.png" />
<br />    <br /> 
Finally, wrap the whole log in aluminum foil to protect the foie gras during cooking and to ensure more even heat distribution. This wrapping step should be done twice as well.
<br />    <br /> 
<img src="/assets/img/foiegras13.png" />
<br />    <br /> 
Now, the cooking! Heat the water to just below boiling: 92°C (198°F). Submerge the foie gras for 6 minutes for a 600-gram log. During cooking, make sure to turn the logs.
<br />    <br /> 
<img src="/assets/img/foiegras14.png" />
<br />    <br /> 
While the foie gras is cooking, prepare a container of cold water in which the logs will be plunged immediately after cooking. Then let the logs rest in the refrigerator for another night.
<br />    <br />

<br />    <br /> 
Finally, enjoy your foie gras the way you like it :)
