        <h1>Restaurants I like around the world</h1>
		<p>For each city I visited, here is one restaurant I loved.</p>

		<h2>Shanghai, China</h2> 
    <h3>佳家湯包 (Jia Jia Tang Bao）</h3>

      It’s a cute restaurant offering many crab dishes,located at the north of People’s Parc and surrounded by many other food places.<br />
      <img src="/assets/img/foodpvg2.png" alt="foodpvg2" />
      In a nutshell, the food was delicious and if you like crab you can’t be disappointed. As represented on the following pictures, you can see meals that might appear familiar, but they are flawless!<br />

      The dumplings were filled with a yummy crab filling and some soup (which destroyed my pant, beware).<br />

      The noodle meal were somehow funny, I guess you are supposed to put all the stuffing on top and then mix; although the taste was amazing, it was so fat I doubt one single human being can finish it alone... (or at what cost?),I would still re-take this meal if I was in the area.<br />

      Finally the soup with sorts of wonton was good but definitely an overkill in terms of quantity.<br /> 
          
           Overall the place is clean, the staff is nice but push to consumption, and the food is great. <br /> A must-go!<br>
