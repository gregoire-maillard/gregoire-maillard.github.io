		<h2>About this page</h2>

		<p>For each city I visited, here is one restaurant I loved.<br>
		</p>


		<h3>Shanghai, China</h3> 

		<p>佳家湯包 (Jia Jia Tang Bao）
      <img src="/assets/img/foodpvg1.png" alt="foodpvg1" />
      
      It’s a cute restaurant offering many crab dishes,<br /> 
      located at the north of People’s Parc and surrounded by many other food places.<br />
      <img src="/assets/img/foodpvg2.png" alt="foodpvg2" />
      In a nutshell, the food was delicious and if you like crab you can’t be disappointed.<br /> 
      As represented on the pics, you can see many familiar meals but they are flawless!<br />

     The dumplings were filled with a yummy crab filling and some soup (which destroyed my pant, beware).<br /> 
      The noodle meal was kinda funny, I guess you are supposed to put all the stuffing on top and then mix;<br /> 
       although the taste was amazing, it was so fat I doubt one single human being can finish it alone<br /> 
        (or at what cost?),<br /> 
         I would still re-take this meal if I was in the area.<br /> 
          Finally the soup with sorts of wonton was good but definitely an overkill in terms of quantity.<br /> 
          <img src="/assets/img/foodpvg5.png" alt="foodpvg5" />
           Overall the place is clean, the staff is nice but push to consumption, and the food is great. <br /> A must-go!<br>
