    <h2>Seoul, South Korea</h2> 
    <h3>한일각 </h3> 

    <p>
      <img src="/assets/img/foodicn1.png" alt="foodicn1" />
      It’s my hidden student gem in Korea. It’s located in a small apartment on the first floor of a random building in Itaewon, usually empty of people, with a desk full of papers and messy folders that have been there for years at the entrance, and a big TV continuously playing Korean news which makes you feel like you are at your grand-parents. <br />
      <img src="/assets/img/foodicn2.png" alt="foodicn2" />
      The only meal I ever tried there (and probably will ever try) is their ridiculously delicious jajangmyeon (you can use the following Korean characters if it’s more useful to you: 자장면).<br /> 
      <img src="/assets/img/foodicn3.png" alt="foodicn3" />
      This is basically some noodles covered with a huge batch of brown sauce (not the American one) with some pieces of pork and onion, it tastes delicious, and cherry on the top it’s only 4$.<br /> 
      <img src="/assets/img/foodicn4.png" alt="foodicn4" />
      I strongly recommend it as it is a Korean classic cheat meal, and the place is more than authentic!

		<h2>Shanghai, China</h2> 
    <h3>佳家湯包 (Jia Jia Tang Bao）</h3> 

		<p>

      It’s a cute restaurant offering many crab dishes,located at the north of People’s Parc and surrounded by many other food places.<br />
      <img src="/assets/img/foodpvg2.png" alt="foodpvg2" />
      In a nutshell, the food was delicious and if you like crab you can’t be disappointed. As represented on the following pictures, you can see meals that might appear familiar, but they are flawless!<br />

      The dumplings were filled with a yummy crab filling and some soup (which destroyed my pant, beware).<br /> 
      <img src="/assets/img/foodpvg4.png" alt="foodpvg4" />
      The noodle meal were somehow funny, I guess you are supposed to put all the stuffing on top and then mix; although the taste was amazing, it was so fat I doubt one single human being can finish it alone... (or at what cost?),I would still re-take this meal if I was in the area.<br />

      Finally the soup with sorts of wonton was good but definitely an overkill in terms of quantity.<br /> 
          
           Overall the place is clean, the staff is nice but push to consumption, and the food is great. <br /> A must-go!<br>
