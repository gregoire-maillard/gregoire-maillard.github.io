    <h2>Seoul</h2> 
    <h3>한일각 </h3> 

    <p>
      <img src="/assets/img/foodicn1.png" alt="foodicn1" />
      It’s my hidden student gem in Korea. It’s located in a small apartment on the first floor of a random building in Itaewon, usually empty of people, with a desk full of papers and messy folders that have been there for years at the entrance, and a big TV continuously playing Korean news which makes you feel like you are at your grand-parents. <br />
      <img src="/assets/img/foodicn2.png" alt="foodicn2" />
      The only meal I ever tried there (and probably will ever try) is their ridiculously delicious jajangmyeon (you can use the following Korean characters if it’s more useful to you: 자장면).<br /> 
      <img src="/assets/img/foodicn3.png" alt="foodicn3" />
      This is basically some noodles covered with a huge batch of brown sauce (not the American one) with some pieces of pork and onion, it tastes delicious, and cherry on the top it’s only 4$.<br /> 
      <img src="/assets/img/foodicn4.png" alt="foodicn4" />
      I strongly recommend it as it is a Korean classic cheat meal, and the place is more than authentic!

		<h2>Shanghai</h2> 
    <h3>佳家湯包 (Jia Jia Tang Bao）</h3> 

		<p>
      <img src="/assets/img/foodpvg1.png" alt="foodpvg1" />
      
      It’s a cute restaurant offering many crab dishes,located at the north of People’s Parc and surrounded by many other food places.<br />
      <img src="/assets/img/foodpvg2.png" alt="foodpvg2" />
      In a nutshell, the food was delicious and if you like crab you can’t be disappointed. As represented on the following pictures, you can see meals that might appear familiar, but they are flawless!<br /> 
      <img src="/assets/img/foodpvg3.png" alt="foodpvg3" />
      The dumplings were filled with a yummy crab filling and some soup (which destroyed my pant, beware).<br /> 
      <img src="/assets/img/foodpvg4.png" alt="foodpvg4" />
      The noodle meal were somehow funny, I guess you are supposed to put all the stuffing on top and then mix; although the taste was amazing, it was so fat I doubt one single human being can finish it alone... (or at what cost?),I would still re-take this meal if I was in the area.<br /> 
      <img src="/assets/img/foodpvg5.png" alt="foodpvg5" />
      Finally the soup with sorts of wonton was good but definitely an overkill in terms of quantity.<br /> 
          
           Overall the place is clean, the staff is nice but push to consumption, and the food is great. <br /> A must-go!<br>

      <h2>Taipei</h2> 
      <h3>菲登早午餐</h3> 
  
      <p>
        <img src="/assets/img/foodtpe1.png" alt="foodtpe1" />
        It’s a Chinese breakfast place as you’d find many walking across Taipei streets. <br />
        <img src="/assets/img/foodtpe2.png" alt="foodtpe2" />
        Everything is written in Chinese so you either need a Chinese friend or must accept your fate.<br /> 
        <img src="/assets/img/foodtpe3.png" alt="foodtpe3" />
        It was very good overall, really like the savory dishes which were offering some unusual flavors; I recommend especially the one full of basil.<br /> 
        <img src="/assets/img/foodtpe4.png" alt="foodtpe4" />
        The sweet dish represented in the pictures is a sort of bread with chocolate, not worth some Nutella bread but it was fluffy so it was good. For drinks, I recommend the hot black sesame one as well.<br />

        <h2>Tel-Aviv</h2> 
        <h3>ויקטור דגים (Victor Dagim)</h3> 
    
        <p>
          <img src="/assets/img/foodtlv1.png" alt="foodtlv1" />
          It's crazy how the streets of Tel-Aviv are full of sushi and pizza restaurants, and how difficult it is to find a mediterranean one! Yet I found this one specialized in fish in the middle of Florentin's district and I loved it!<br />
          <img src="/assets/img/foodtlv2.png" alt="foodtlv2" />
          All the products looked and tasted very fresh and their limonade would quench anyone's thirst.<br /> 
          <img src="/assets/img/foodtlv3.png" alt="foodtlv3" />
          The main meal was a mix of fresh cooked fish, tomatoes, green onions, cream, and olive oil. Overall, it felt pretty light and perfect for the warm weather.

          <h2>Tokyo</h2> 
          <h3>松栄 渋谷スクランブルスクエア店 (Matsue）</h3> 
      
          <p>
            <img src="/assets/img/foodnrt1.png" alt="foodnrt1" />
            It’s a fancy sushi place located near Shibuya crossing, and probably the best one I ever went too! <br />
            <img src="/assets/img/foodnrt2.png" alt="foodnrt2" />
            Two setups exist; either at the counter facing the chefs and seeing your different meals being prepared, or some private rooms for large groups.<br /> 
            <img src="/assets/img/foodnrt3.png" alt="foodnrt3" />
            I had the chance of trying the full set which comprises multiples amuse-bouches/starters, sashimis, nigiris, and different drinks.<br /> 
            <img src="/assets/img/foodnrt4.png" alt="foodnrt4" />
            All the products were very fresh and felt qualitative.<br /> 
            <img src="/assets/img/foodnrt5.png" alt="foodnrt5" />
            The chef was describing the different dishes and was very fun. <br /> 
            <img src="/assets/img/foodnrt6.png" alt="foodnrt6" />               
            Also the highball is delish. Booking in advance is recommended I assume!<br /> A must-go!<br>
