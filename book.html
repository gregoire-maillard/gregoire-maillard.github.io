        <h2> 2025 - Ohran Pamuk</h2>  
        Turkish novelist and Istanbul lover, Ohran Pamuk is the recipient of the 2006 Nobel Prize in Literature.
        I chose to start with this author for his major impact on the Turkish literature as well as for the wide thematics Pamuk covered over the last 30 years.

          <h3>İstanbul: Hatıralar ve Şehir (2003)</h3>

   <br />    <br /> 
   This book was a fun and unexpected ride I’d say. Published in 2003, it juggles between being an essay on the city of Istanbul as well as being the author’s memoire of his youth which also occurs in Istanbul as the young Pamuk wouldn’t really want to go anywhere else.
   <br />    <br /> 
   Pamuk loves Istanbul like he loves his family. As he hinted at, maybe he loves Istanbul as anyone would love the city they live in as one might not have the choice to go anywhere else. Or as the author would say himself:“Why should we expect a city to cure us of our spiritual pains? Perhaps we cannot help loving our city like a family. But we still have to decide which part of the city we love and invent the reasons why.” and « I’ve accepted the city into which I was born in the same way I’ve accepted my body ... This is my fate, and there’s no sense arguing with it ».
   <br />    <br /> 
   I loved the chapters where Pamuk describes different parts of his young self. The chapter where he talks about his first love is breathtaking, the one where he fights verbally with his mother is also intense and kept me wanting more arguments just to be able to not finish that chapter. His views on money and religion were quite interesting and original in the way that he was able to discuss with his old-self and some ideas might feel unique for the foreign reader.
   <br />    <br /> 
   I might be more mitigated on the essay on the city although it had many great parts. A lot of emphasis is made on the profound sadness that emanates from the city, its collective melancholy: huzun. I might be biased by my French, but I was pretty fascinated with the thesis that the way that Istanbul people view themselves is intensively linked with how the foreign eyes, and especially the French artists, are seeing them, as well as how they are trying to flee any aspect for which foreigners would be tempted to practice Orientalism. There is this sequence of actions where the western literature creates a romanticized image of Turkey, which Turkish intellectuals internalized and which end up shaping the city’s collective consciousness, full of melancholy and an aesthetically pleasing sense of destruction. 
   <br />    <br /> 
   Mingling both the essay and the memoir put me off of this book many times, feeling a disinterest sometimes with the repetition of the same ideas. But at the same time, it was a great way to mix two different kind of melancholies which happened to be strongly correlated: the one of the author as well as the one of the whole city.
   <br />    <br /> 
   Overall, this book is a great read for the one among you that would read Pamuk books as some of his reference, anecdotes, and personal stories can be found in his fiction works. Also, the book has a lot of old and sometimes personal pictures of the city, the author, and other illustrations. Many of them are from Ara Güler, a famous Istanbul photographer!
